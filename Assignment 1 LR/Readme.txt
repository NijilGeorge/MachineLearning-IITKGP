1. The problem statement consists of 4 parts. For each of these parts, the corresponding source codes and the outputs obtained in that step are placed in their respective folders.
2. For some parts, like part 2 and part 4, we are reusing the same data obtained in some other part. E.g. part 2 uses the output of part 1 and part 4 uses the output of part 3. Hence it is advised to run the parts in order ( else we will be reusing the data from a previous time). 
3. To run any code, on a Linux shell, type  ` python <filename.py> `         Any data files generated are stored automatically and the plots are displayed during execution (not stored).
4. The files generated during the execution of part 1 are the dataset, learnt weights and the errors (w.r.t degree) of the models. These are stored in the first folder with appropriate names.
5. The second part has no storable output. Only the plots are generated and displayed
6. The third part generates similar data like 1st one, for the three instances 100,1000,10000. For plotting the error vs size graph, the same dataset from the 1st part is reused.
