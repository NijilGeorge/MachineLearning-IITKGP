Part1:

1. Each part of the assignment is written in a separate file with appropriate names. For running the file, type 
python3 <filename.py>

2. For this part, the dataset used is the file 'dataset for part 1.xlsx', provided in the google drive link.

3. Place this excel sheet in the same directory as the python script files.

Part2:
1. Similar to the previous part, each part of the assignment is written in a separate file with appropriate names. For running the file, type 
python3 <filename.py>

2. The dataset for this part is provided in the drive link. After downloading the zipped file, extract the directory 'dataset for part 2' in the same directory as the code files.

3. This folder contains five files, the train and test data and the words.
Relative to the source files, the path of each of these files is,

'dataset for part 2/traindata.txt'
'dataset for part 2/trainlabel.txt'
'dataset for part 2/testdata.txt'
'dataset for part 2/testlabel.txt'
'dataset for part 2/words.txt'

The outputs for these codes will be printed directly on the terminal. The plots will be displayed automatically.
