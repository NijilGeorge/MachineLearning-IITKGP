1. The assignment consists of 3 parts, each of which is written in separate files. Place these three files in the same directory along with the input data file named as ‘AAAI.csv’
2. In order to run any part of the program, run it as
python3 <filename.py>
1. Note: The third part, of calculating the NMI values require output from the first and second parts. Hence, it should be run only after running the previous parts. Since the data is passed using np.save and np.load, we need to have the files in the same directory.
